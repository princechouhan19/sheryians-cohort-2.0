### 2. Loops, Nested Loops, Pattern Programming

- [x] Types of loops :- Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.  
  **Entry control loops** check the condition before executing the loop body. If the condition is false initially, the loop body will not execute at all. Examples of entry control loops are `for` and `while` loops.  
  **Exit control loops** execute the loop body first and then check the condition. This guarantees that the loop body executes at least once, even if the condition is false. The `do-while` loop is an example of an exit control loop.
