## ### 2. Loops, Nested Loops, Pattern Programming

### ✅ Core Concepts

- [x] **Types of Loops**  
  Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.

  - **Entry Control Loops**  
    These loops check the condition **before** executing the loop body.  
    If the condition is false initially, the loop body will not execute.  
    **Examples:** `for`, `while`

  - **Exit Control Loops**  
    These loops execute the loop body first and then check the condition.  
    The loop body executes at least once.  
    **Example:** `do-while`

- [x] Understanding the use of loops  
- [x] `for` loop
